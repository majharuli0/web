      {
        question: "Where is the best place to install the Seenyor device?",

        question:
          "What should I do if the device won’t connect to Wi-Fi during installation?",

      {
        question: "Does the device need line of sight to monitor effectively?",
        answer:
          "Yes, a clear line of sight enhances accuracy. Ensure the device has an unobstructed view of the area it’s intended to monitor.",
      },

        question: "What should I do if the device falls or gets displaced?",
